PhD

I co-supervise a PhD within the ERC Multiples project Emma Bordier, who is studying the multiplicity of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs).

BSc
======
In the first semester of 2020 I am supervising two Bacherlors' students in a project which examines the circumstellar dust of MYSOs using infrared imaging.
