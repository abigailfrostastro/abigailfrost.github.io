I am a postdoctoral research associate whose interested in star and planet formation, massive stars and stellar multiplicity. I study these objects using some of the most powerful telescopes available, such as the [Very Large Telescope/Interferometer](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/) (VLTI) in Chile. My journey into astrophysics started with my masters degree (MPhys) at the [University of Exeter](http://www.skraus.eu/group.html). I went on to study for my PhD in Astrophysics at the [University of Leeds](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/physics/pgr/4861/abigail-frost), which focussed on the study of the the circumstellar environments of massive forming stars and their discs. I currently work at [KU Leuven](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/junior-staff/abigail-frost) in Belgium as a part of the [ERC MULTIPLES project](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/research-projects/multiples/). My various research pursuits are described below.

Massive stellar multiplicity
======

Within the [ERC MULTIPLES project](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/research-projects/multiples/) group, I use infrared interferometry to search for and characterise binary and multiple massive star systems. In particular I work with data from the [GRAVITY](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/gravity.html) and [PIONIER](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/pionier.html) at the VLTI. So far during the first year of my postdoctoral placement within the group, I have been working on a few projects. 

The first concerns the massive binary system HD148937, a member of the rare Of?p class of massive stars, where one star within the system is magnetic and the other is not, which raises questions as to how this could occur. Working with multi-epoch inteferometric and spectroscopic data, we are characterising the orbital parameters of the system and determing the properties of the original star, with future plans to do evolutionary modelling of the source to determine the origin of the magnetic star. A paper is in preparation.

The second project seeks to investigate the mulplicity of B stars. While the binary fraction of O stars has been characterised through interferometry, this is yet to be acheived for B stars. I have analysed PIONIER data of a sample of 40 B stars, and find a high multiplicity fraction for the sample as well as the presence of a significant fraction of high-order systems. A paper is in preparation.

The final project seeks to determine the origin of massive stellar multiplicity by studying forming massive stars, or massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). Using interferometric data obtained with GRAVITY, one star forming region M17 is being analysed. This project is the subject of PhD student Emma Bordier, who I co-supervise with Prof. Hugues Sana.

The circumstellar environments of massive young stellar objects 
======

One of my interests is studying the envrionments and disks surrounding massive young stellar objects. While low-mass star formation has been observed to the point where multiple disc phases have been observed and identified, disc evolution is yet to be confirmed for high-mass stars. I studied MYSOs extensively during my PhD, using a combination of infrared interferometry, imaging, spectral energy distributions and 3D radiative transfer modellings. I am currently involved in a number of follow-up projects focussed on this work using, MATISSE, spase-aperture-masking (SAM) where an imaging telescope produces interferometric observables through the use of a mask and future plans to use the ELT. The pilot paper from my PhD work which focusses on a potential transitions disc around an MYSO can be found [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...625A..44F/abstract) and two papers presenting the results of multi-scale survey of MYSO discs and their findings have been submitted. 

Spectroscopy of Herbig Discs
======

As a member of the Instituut voor Sterrekunde at KU Leuven, I enjoy observing with the HERMES spectrometer at the KU Leuven-owned Mercator telescope. With my observing time, a new project I have started uses the instrument to study the inner regions of Herbig discs using optical/infrared spectroscopy in collaboration with Dr. Alice Booth (Leiden Observatory) and Dr. James Miley (ALMA).

Astronomers for Planet Earth
======

I am a member of the [Astronomers for Planet Earth](https://astronomersforplanet.earth/), which seeks to bring astronomers together to help engage the public with the details of the climate crisis and to discuss how we can make astronomy as a field more environmentally friendly. I am on the SOC for the group's proposed sessions for the European Astronomy Society 2021 conference.
