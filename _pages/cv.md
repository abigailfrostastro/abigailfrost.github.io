Education
======
* MPhys in Physics with Astrophysics, University of Exeter, 2015
* Ph.D in Astrophysics, University of Leeds, 2019

Experience
======
* Jul 2016: Visiting Student
  * University of Sydney
  * Taught the intricacies of the technique of sparse aperture masking, where using a mask with an imaging instrument results in visibilities andclosure phases. Received data reduction pipelines for use with the T-ReCs, NIRC2 and NACO instruments.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Peter Tuthill, Dr. Barnaby Norris

* Oct-Dec 2015: Research Assistant
  * European Southern Observatory
  * Three-month placement at ESO’s Santiago Office enabled by the ESO Director General Discretionary Fund. Studied mid-IR interferometry and3D radiative transfer modelling. 
  * Supervisor: Dr. Willem-Jan de Wit
  
  * Jun-Aug 2015: Summer Student
  * European Southern Observatory
  * Awarded a funding for the program among∼15 other students from over 100 applicants. Project Title - ‘Relating the ionised and warmmolecular gas in three massive star forming regions’
  * Supervisor: Dr. Pamela Klaassen
  
Prizes
======
* 1st Prize, Poster Competition at the international Olympian Symposium 2018 ‘Gas from milli- to mega-parsecs’
* 1st Prize, Oxford University Press Prize for the best student poster at the National Astronomy Meeting

Telescope time as PI
======
* VLTI/MATISSE
    * ‘Imaging the substructure of a massive protostellar disk’ - 13.5hr
    * Science Verification Time ‘Imaging the first transition disc around a massive protostar’ - awarded 20% of the available MATISSE SV time (10% of overall cycle) - 1 night
* VLT/VISIR
    * ‘VISIR/Sparse Aperture Masking 10𝜇m survey of nearby massive young stellar objects : envelopestructure and evolution’ - 2 nights (observed in visitor mode)
    * VLT/VISIR ‘VISIR survey of nearby massive young stellar objects with MIDI N-band interferometry.’ - 7hrs

Outreach
======
* ‘Astronomy for All’ Workshop at the University of Leeds - Developing sign language for astrophysics - September 2019
  * Working with Dr. Olja Panic (who runs this initiative) at the University of Leeds I helped to explain astrophysical concepts to enable thegeneration of new signs for British Sign Language. We worked with linguists and deaf amateur astronomers/instrumentalists to develop signsrelevant to star formation.
* ‘Pint of Science’ Festival - I hosted, presented at and helped to organize days of this outreach festival which is held in 34 cities across the UK.
* Research Nights - Public engagement talk. Talk title: ‘How do giants grow? Where the most massive stars in our universe come from’ - Public audience

Skills
======
* Computing
  * Python
  * IDL
  * Basic C++
  * Linux
* Modelling
  * Radiative transfer (HOCHUNK Whitney 2013, Hyperion Robitaille)
  * Geometric modelling
* Writing
  * Attended Writing for non-peers and press’ at ‘Let’s talk Science’ 2020 (KU Leuven)
  * Write for ‘Popular Astronomy’ magazine
  
Service and leadership
======
* [Astronomers for Earth](https://astronomersforplanet.earth/)
* LOC/VOC for 2 KU Leuven seminars
* Bachelors and PhD student supervisor
