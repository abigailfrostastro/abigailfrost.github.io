Education
======
* MPhys in Physics with Astrophysics, University of Exeter, 2015
* Ph.D in Astrophysics, University of Leeds, 2019

Experience
======
* Jul 2016: Visiting Student
  * University of Sydney
  * Taught the intricacies of the technique of sparse aperture masking, where using a mask with an imaging instrument results in visibilities andclosure phases. Received data reduction pipelines for use with the T-ReCs, NIRC2 and NACO instruments.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Peter Tuthill, Dr. Barnaby Norris

* Oct-Dec 2015: DTGF Student
  * European Southern Observatory
  * Three-month placement at ESO‚Äôs Santiago Office enabled by the ESO Director General Discretionary Fund (DTGF). Studied mid-IR interferometry and3D radiative transfer modelling. 
  * Supervisor: Dr. Willem-Jan de Wit
  
* Jun-Aug 2015: Leiden/ESA Program for Summer students (LEAPS)
  * Leiden Observatory
  * Awarded a funding for the program among ~15 other students from over 100 applicants. Project Title - ‚ÄòRelating the ionised and warmmolecular gas in three massive star forming regions‚Äô
  * Supervisor: Dr. Pamela Klaassen
  
Prizes
======
* 1st Prize, Poster Competition at the international Olympian Symposium 2018 ‚ÄòGas from milli- to mega-parsecs‚Äô
* 1st Prize, Oxford University Press Prize for the best student poster at the National Astronomy Meeting

Telescope time as PI
======
* VLTI/MATISSE
    * ‚ÄòImaging the substructure of a massive protostellar disk‚Äô - 13.5hr
    * Science Verification Time ‚ÄòImaging the first transition disc around a massive protostar‚Äô - awarded 20% of the available MATISSE SV time (10% of overall cycle) - 1 night
* VLT/VISIR
    * ‚ÄòVISIR/Sparse Aperture Masking 10ùúám survey of nearby massive young stellar objects : envelopestructure and evolution‚Äô - 2 nights (observed in visitor mode)
    * VLT/VISIR ‚ÄòVISIR survey of nearby massive young stellar objects with MIDI N-band interferometry.‚Äô - 7hrs

Outreach
======
* Research Nights - Public engagement talk. Talk title: ‚ÄòHow do giants grow? Where the most massive stars in our universe come from‚Äô - Nov. 2018
* Writer for [Popular Astronomy Magazine](https://www.popastro.com/main_spa1/about-the-spa/our-lively-magazine-popular-astronomy/) - 2018 - present
* ‚ÄòPint of Science‚Äô Festival - I hosted, presented at and helped to organize days of this outreach festival which is held in 34 cities across the UK - 2017-2019
* ‚ÄòAstronomy for All‚Äô Workshop at the University of Leeds - Developing sign language for astrophysics - Sep. 2019
  * Working with Dr. Olja Panic (who runs this initiative) at the University of Leeds I helped to explain astrophysical concepts to enable the generation of new signs for British Sign Language. We worked with linguists and deaf amateur astronomers and instrumentalists to develop signs relevant to star formation.
* School visit to De Zonnewijzer school in Wijgmaal, Belgium. Presented the talk 'How do you build a star?' to a class of 10-11yr olds - Oct. 2020
* Outreach talk at ESO IR 2020 conference outreach program ["Infrared Astronomy for everyone and worldwide!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab_channel=HausderAstronomie&feature=youtu.be&utm_campaign=SocialSignIn&utm_medium=social&utm_source=Facebook&v=wK8rCl-Pvl4&app=desktop) - Oct. 2020
* Outreach talk for the 'Astrozoom' amateur astronomers association - Nov. 2020
* Part of the 'Skype a Scientist' program - discuss astronomy and astrophysics with children from kindergarten to high school ages. Schools I have worked with are:
  * The New American Academy Charter School - Dec. 2020
  
Service and leadership
