Hi Abigail,

I'm Ose, community director for The Blackett Lab Family. Sorry for contacting you in
such a weird way, but I couldn't find a discreet alternative! I'm contacting you 
because the last group email that we sent was rejected by your kuleuven.be address, 
and I see that you're no longer at that university. If you'd like to continue 
receiving emails from The Blackett Lab Family, could you please send an address that
works to community@theblackettlabfamily.com?

Thanks!
Ose
