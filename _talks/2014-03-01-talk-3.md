Young massive stars have the power to influence their surroundings from local to galactic scales. Despite this, their rarity and deeply embedded nature has limited our understanding of their formation. Work on single objects has given us valuable snapshots of the massive star formation process, but the fact remains that a lack of observational data prevents us from conclusively confirming its details. Combining various observational techniques can assist with this by providing a more complete view of MYSOs. My work fits 3D radiative transfer models to three different observables simultaneously to constrain the physical characteristics of MYSOs, tracing multiple scales through the combination of infrared interferometric data (~10mas resolution), imaging data (~100mas resolution) and SEDs. In this talk I will present the results obtained when applying this analysis to a sample of ~10 MYSOs. the largest sample analysed with such a dataset, and the resultant implications for massive star formation.
