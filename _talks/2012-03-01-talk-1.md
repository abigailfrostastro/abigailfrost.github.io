Protostellar disks play key roles in the accretion process and formation of planetesimals for low-mass stars, and form various substructures, as different physical processes occur within them. Massive stars (M>8Mdot) form from the same clouds of dust and gas as low-mass stars and affect the both their own stellar environment and galaxies as a whole. Despite their importance, the formation of massive stars is poorly understood as they are deeply embedded, distant and rare, which introduces more observational challenges. While disks have recently been found around massive protostars massive disk evolution is yet to be constrained. In my talk, I will discuss our recent work which has, using a multi-scale analysis on a sample of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs), detected inner holes and gap-like substructures within the MYSO disks. I will also tie these geometrical traits to an independently determined evolutionary sequence and discuss what this means for disk evolution around MYSOs.
