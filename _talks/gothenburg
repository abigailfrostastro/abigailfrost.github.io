Discs are a crucial component of the low-mass star formation process and many types of discs have been
found around low-mass protostars. The transition disc [e.g. 1] is one such type and represents an
evolutionary step from the young, accreting protoplanetary disc to the older debris disc when observed
around low-mass stars. Massive protostars are deeply embedded and difficult to observe, and as such only a
few cases of early-type Keplerian discs have been identified around O-type stars [2] [3] [4].
In this talk I will discuss our recent work [5] which infers the presence of the first observed transition disc
around a massive young stellar object. By simultaneously fitting a 3D radiative transfer model to infrared
interferometric data (MIDI, VLTI), a near-diffraction-limited image (VISIR, VLT) and a spectral energy
distribution, we have constrained the geometry of an MYSO from ~10mas scales upwards. Our results show
a that a disk is required to satisfy the interferometric data, that the inner circumstellar regions must cleared
out to a radius three times the size of the dust sublimation radius, and that the MYSO is less dense than
others of its class. These characteristics imply that this object may be one of the first observed examples of a
transition disc phase around a massive young star, and a prime example to test theories of circumstellar disc
dispersal and the end stages of accretion in massive protostars.
