excerpt: 'This paper describes a multi-scale survey of a sample of MYSOs. By applying a multi-scale methodology including RT modelling, interferometry imaging and spectral energy distributions we probed eight MYSOs in depth, allowing the disks, outflows and envelopes of a variety of MYSOs to be determined. We find that a number of the disks in the MYSOs show cleared inner regions implying something (potentially photoevaporation or binary interaction) is disrupting material beyond the sublimation radius for these sources.
