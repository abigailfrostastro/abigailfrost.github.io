excerpt: 'This paper describes a multi-scale study of an MYSO which encorporated N-band interferometry, Q-band imaging, spectral energy distributions and 3D radiative transfer modelling. By fitting the three observables to one RT model simultaneously, the MYSO environment was probed at 0.01", 0.1" and as a whole, which allowed the inner disc to be probed and characteristics analgous to the transitions discs around low-mass stars to be detected.'
